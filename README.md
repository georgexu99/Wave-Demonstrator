## Wave-Demonstrator: a doppler effect simulation using functional programming ##

I made this simple application to use as part of my demonstrations as a TA for UBC's introductory programming course, CPSC 110. It uses 
crucial elements of the course, such as <strong>recursion</strong> and <strong>data abstraction</strong> to encapsulate the problem domain of having an arbitrary number of "waves" be simulated. An open application running is shown below. This is an exceptional app especially on computers with touch capabilities, as <strong>Wave-Demonstrator</strong> is fully multi-touch compatible.
